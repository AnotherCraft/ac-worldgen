# Voronoi & domain warping
[Worley noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worley_noise) is a noise working on the principles of [Voronoi diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram): you start with points randomly spread across the space, the noise value is then based on the distance from the nearest points. WOGLAC provides the `voronoi2D` function to play around with the Voronoi noise [[function documentation]](../function_list.md#voronoi2d).
